# Design Migration to Supabase Storage

This script migrates existing design images from external URLs or data URLs to Supabase Storage.

## Prerequisites

1. **Create the `designs` bucket in Supabase Storage** (see `STORAGE_SETUP.md`)
2. **Set up environment variables** in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```
   
   You can find the service role key in Supabase Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API â†’ Service role key (keep this secret!)

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Dry Run (Preview what will be migrated)
```bash
npm run migrate:designs:dry-run
```

This will show you what would be migrated without making any changes.

### Migrate All Designs
```bash
npm run migrate:designs
```

### Migrate a Specific Design
```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-designs-to-storage.ts --design-id=your-design-id
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Fetches all designs** from the `designs` table
2. **Uploads images** to Supabase Storage:
   - Main images â†’ `designs/users/{user_id}/{timestamp}-{random}-main.png`
   - Thumbnails â†’ `designs/users/{user_id}/{timestamp}-{random}-thumb.png`
   - Variations â†’ `designs/users/{user_id}/variations/{timestamp}-{random}.png`
3. **Updates database records** with new Supabase Storage URLs
4. **Skips images already in Supabase Storage** (checks if URL contains your Supabase URL)

## Features

- âœ… Handles both HTTP URLs and data URLs (base64)
- âœ… Automatically detects and preserves content type (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- âœ… Skips images already in Supabase Storage
- âœ… Migrates design variations (iterations) as well
- âœ… Provides detailed progress output
- âœ… Error handling - continues if one design fails
- âœ… Dry run mode to preview changes

## Output Example

```

```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing required environment variables"
- Make sure `.env.local` exists and contains both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Error: "Storage upload error: new row violates row-level security policy"
- Make sure you've set up the storage bucket policies (see `STORAGE_SETUP.md`)
- The script uses the service role key, which should bypass RLS, but you may need to check your bucket settings

### Error: "Failed to fetch image"
- The external URL may be inaccessible or expired
- Check if the URL is still valid in your browser
- For Fal.ai URLs, they may have expiration times

### Images not uploading
- Check if the `designs` bucket exists in Supabase Storage
- Verify the bucket is public (for reading) or that policies allow authenticated uploads
